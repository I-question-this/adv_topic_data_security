The data is stored in the data folder. For now, the data is stored
in zip file format, because git have a limit of 100MB, so if you
want to use the data, you need to unzip those file first.

And there is examples in the example folder

if you want to run the example code, you can first type:
    python examples/cnn_test.py -h
then the screen will print out help msg

when you run the code, you can use the data in the data folder,
you may also use the data of yourself, however, you will need to
change the data format so the data will compatiable to the test
code.
